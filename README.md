# Cognitive-Forecasting-Tool
A price forecasting tool made in Flask

This is a website I made using Flask and htmL, CSS and Bootstrap for frontend. 

It uses the Data given and Forecast the proce of three che,icals over a period of time. 

The Python libraries used in this are Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Dash. 

It displays the final result in form of a graph and a table. I used Plotly.Js for displaying the Plot. 

I'm still working of adding more features and improving the Front-end of the Website. 

Any suggestions are welcome. 

Thanks.
